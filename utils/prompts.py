CTQ_PROMPT = """
Given the above conversation and the latest user question which might make reference to the context in 
the chat history, generate a standalone question which can be understood without the chat history.

Remember to make the context clear in your output. If the question is referring to a retrieved context, return 
the question in relation to the context for easy understanding of the task.

Remember to only restructure the question if it is relation to the chat history. If not, do not edit the question and 
leave it as the user wrote it.

Do NOT answer the question, just restructure it if needed and otherwise, return it as it is.

Given the user question below, classify it as either being about information provided in a context by the user 
or information that does not relate to a specific context

The classes would be either `Retrieval` or `General`.
Some ground rules for classifying the questions:

For `Retrieval`:
- If the user specifies that the information is in a document of any sort that they provided, it is a Retrieval task
- If the previous conversations are related to a retrieved context, classify the follow up question to be about 
Retrieval

For `General`:
- ONLY if the question does not relate to a context provided by the user.

NEVER respond with more than one word; Your response should be either one of the classes ONLY. Finally, if you do not 
know what to classify the question as, classify it as `General`.
